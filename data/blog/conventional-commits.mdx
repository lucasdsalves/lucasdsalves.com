## Conventional commits, have you ever heard of it?

As developers, we are writers. As writers, we intend to communicate through everything we write such as code, documentation and also commits messages.

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a standardized format for writing **commit messages**.

By adopting conventional commits, teams can create commit messages that follow the same structure, and format,
making easier to review and understand changes that have been made in the codebase.

It clearly helps avoiding terrible commit messages with no meaning and increases team's communication through git commits messages.

Conventional Commits are related to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) assisting in controlling major, minors and patch versions.

## How does it work?

According to Conventional Commits, the commit message should be structured as:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

The **scope** is optional and used to indicate which part of the project was changed.

The **description** is a brief description of the change. Should be written in imperative mood.

The **body** is free-form and may consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.

## Types of commits

- **feat** - introduces a new feature to the codebase
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **docs** - changes to documentation
- **style** - changes that are related to white-spaces, formatting, removing comments, missing semil-colons
- **refactor** - reactoring of code
- **test** - addition of tests or correcting existing ones
- **build** - changes related to the build of the application or external dependencies
- **ci** - changes made to the continuous integration configuration files and scripts

_BREAKING CHANGE_

## A few examples

The following examples are on the Conventional Commits documentation

## VS Code extension

The [Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) VS Code extension is very helpful to write commits the Conventional Commits way.
