## Conventional commits, have you ever heard of it?

As developers, we are writers. As writers, we intend to communicate through everything we write such as code, documentation and also commit messages.

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a standardized format for writing **commit messages**.

By adopting conventional commits, teams can create commit messages that follow the same structure, and format, making it easier to review and understand changes made in the codebase.

It clearly helps avoid terrible commit messages with no meaning and increases the team's communication through git commit messages.

Conventional Commits are related to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) assisting in controlling major, minors, and patch versions.

## How does it work?

According to Conventional Commits, the commit message should be structured as:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

The **type** is an indicator of what has changed. Some of the most famous types will be listed [below](#types-of-commits) in this post.

The **scope** is optional and used to indicate which part of the project was changed.

The **description** is a brief description of the change. Should be written in an imperative mood.

The **body** is free-form and may consist of any number of newline-separated paragraphs.

## Types of commits

- **feat** - introduces a new feature to the codebase
- **fix** - a bug fix
- **docs** - changes to documentation
- **style** - changes that are related to white spaces, formatting, removing comments, missing semi-colons
- **refactor** - refactoring of code
- **test** - addition of tests or correcting existing ones
- **build** - changes related to the build of the application or external dependencies
- **ci** - changes made to the continuous integration configuration files and scripts

A commit that has a footer **_BREAKING CHANGE:_**, or appends a **_!_** after the _type[scope]_ introduces a change that can break the app and it is usually associated with a new major version.

## A few examples

The following examples are on the Conventional Commits documentation.

**Commit message with ! to draw attention to breaking change**

```
feat!: send an email to the customer when a product is shipped
```

**Commit message with scope**

```
feat(lang): add Polish language
```

**Commit message with multi-paragraph body and multiple footers**

```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.

## VS Code extension

The [Conventional Commits VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) is very helpful extension to write commits the Conventional Commits way.

## Commitlint

You can also set your project up with Conventional Commits using [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/).

Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the Conventional Commits format.
