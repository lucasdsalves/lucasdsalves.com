summary: 'How I built my personal website'

I think it's very important to own your brand and have a domain online these days.

When building your own website:

- You can create a portfolio and build your image online
- You can explore different stacks from the ones you are using on a daily basis
- Lead with all aspects of a production app - buy a domain, choose a stack, how you're gonna host it, costs, devOps
- You can build things on your way - there's no daily meeting to report your progress ;)

Here's the journey of my personal website.

## Version 1 (2021 - 2022)

The first version of my website was written in plain **HTML** and **CSS** with a few events in **JavaScript**. It was a one page site deployed on **Firebase**.

It was built after watching a tutorial from

## Version 2 (2022 - current)

That's the current version of my website.

Everything is powered by **Next.Js** and components are written using **React**. Blog posts are written using **Markdown**.
Deployment is made through **Vercel**.

_Am I a React expert? Not at all!_

I'm a guy from backend using C# and .NET.
And, sincerely, I'm more familiar with Angular than React.

However, I saw how powerful Next.Js was and found out I could quickly build and deploy a blog combined with Vercel. That was my need at the moment. And of course, I saw it as an opportunity to learn the stack.

I discovered Next.Js after hearing from <a href="https://twitter.com/zenorocha" target="_blank">@zenorocha</a>

## The end?

Probably, that's not the end.
My current website version is totally fresh and I'll be working to evolve it.
