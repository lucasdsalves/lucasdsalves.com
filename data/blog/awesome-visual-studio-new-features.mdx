As a .NET developer, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) is part of my daily basis and one of my favorite IDEs.

In recent updates, Microsoft has launched many cool features in Visual Studio that are just amazing for dev productivity.

On this article, I'll be covering a few of these features that drawn my attention and I could test them lately.

- **Dev tunnels**
- **.http files**
- **API endpoints explorer**

## Dev tunnels

Let's suppose you're developing a new .NET web app or endpoint for your .NET API, it's currently running on localhost and you need to make it temporarily available to others over the internet.

The reasons can be diverse, such as testing the app on other devices, showing the app in a presentation, or inviting others to review your work on a web app or API.

In an ordinary scenario, you would have to deploy it somewhere or find out another way to do it.

Not anymore with dev tunnels.
Dev tunnels enable you to test the app you are building on another device.

According to the definition from Microsoft, "a URL is created that enables any device with an internet connection to connect to an ASP.NET Core project while it runs on localhost".

That's just awesome, isn't it?

Prerequisites
According to Microsoft, you'll need:

- Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6 or later with the ASP.NET and web development workload installed.
- You need to be signed in to Visual Studio to create and use dev tunnels. The feature isn't available in Visual Studio for Mac.
- One or more ASP.NET Core projects. This article uses a solution with two sample projects to demonstrate the feature.

## API endpoints explorer

View -> Other Windows -> Endpoints Explorer

Or you can hit the search bar and look for Endpoints Explorer

It will list endpoints in the API.

Now, right-click on the endpoint you want to test or debug and select Generate Request.

This will lead us to the third topic of this article, .http files.

## .http files

Do you use Postman or Insomnia to work with HTTP requests to a REST API?

You can push this .http file generated, pretty similar to a Postman collection.
